Hangman Game in C++

Welcome to the Hangman Game! ðŸŽ‰ This is a fun little weekend project that I've put together using C++. The game is a classic word-guessing game where you try to guess the hidden word before running out of lives.

Playing the Game:
1. git clone https://github.com/KaranAulakh/Hangman.git 
2. cd Hangman to navigate into the project directory. 
3. run command 'make' to build the project
4. run command './hangman' to execute the game
5. enjoy


Code Structure:
main.cpp: The entry point of the game.
gameState.cpp & gameState.h: Contains the game logic and state management.
gameDisplay.cpp & gameDisplay.h: Manages the user interface and interactions.
